# EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME

## Definition

**EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME**: A governance-compliant analytical framework designed to evaluate, compare, and stress-test physical hypotheses without presupposing General Relativity or Newtonian mechanics, enabling controlled epistemic validation through AUTO DZ ACT within an internal laboratory context.

## Layer-2 Presentation Context

This document provides the standard definition of EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME for governance and terminology compliance purposes.

**Presentation-only** — This definition is provided for structural orientation only.

**Non-scientific** — This repository contains no research implementation or validation of the framework.

**No authority** — Layer-2 has no authority over the framework's scientific execution.

## Terminology Governance

The term **EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME** is the governance-approved terminology for analytical frameworks within the TRIZEL system.

**Deprecated terminology**: Previous terminology is no longer compliant and must not be used in place of EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME.

- **Governance Authority**: Layer-0 (trizel-core) establishes terminology standards
- **Research Implementation**: Layer-1 (trizel-lab) conducts epistemic analysis operations

## Scope Constraints

Layer-2 presentation constraints apply:
- No execution of epistemic analysis
- No validation activities
- No research interpretation
- No scientific claims
- Descriptive reference only
