## What Layer-4.1 Provides

### Explanatory Content

**What TRIZEL Is:**
- Structured system for documenting AI governance research
- Multi-layer architecture with strict boundaries

## Governance Compliance

### Authority and Boundaries

**Explicit Reference to trizel-core:**

**Layer-4.1 Statement:**
- "Layer-4.1 introduces explanation, not operation" — stated explicitly
- Explanatory-only notice in header
- Multiple boundary clarifications

**Layer Preservation:**
- Layer-2 (Display) — untouched, all files preserved
- Layer-2.5 (Epistemic Atlas) — untouched, no modifications
- Layer-3 (Topology) — untouched, no modifications
- Original index.html renamed and preserved

**No Changes Outside Declared Files:**
- Only three new files created (as specified)
- One file renamed (index.html → index_layer2_selector.html)
- No modifications to existing layers
- No modifications to existing assets

### UI Constraints Met

**Read-Only:**
- No forms or input elements
- No interactive controls beyond standard links
- No state management or data storage

**Non-Interactive:**
- Standard HTML links only
- CSS-only visual effects (hover, focus states)
- No JavaScript interactions

**No Implied System Use:**
- Explicit statements about non-operational nature
- Clear boundaries about what TRIZEL is NOT
- No language suggesting system execution

**No Buttons Suggesting Execution:**
- Links are clearly labeled as informational
