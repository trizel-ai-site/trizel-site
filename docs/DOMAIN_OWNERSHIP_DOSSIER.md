## Release and Transfer Notes

### Domain Binding Status

**Current Status:** Domain is being bound to GitHub Pages for this repository (trizel-ai-site/trizel-site).

### "Domain Already Taken" Scenario

If GitHub Pages reports that trizel-ai.com is "already taken," this indicates:

- The domain is currently bound to another GitHub Pages site
- Resolution requires **removing the domain from the other site first**
- Only one GitHub Pages site can claim a custom domain at a time

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Identify which GitHub repository currently claims trizel-ai.com
2. If you control that repository:
   - Remove the CNAME file from that repository, OR
   - Clear the custom domain in that repository's Settings → Pages
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub to release the domain
4. Re-attempt binding in this repository via CNAME file

**If you do NOT control the other repository:**

- Contact GitHub Support with proof of domain ownership
- GitHub Support can forcibly release the domain from the other account
- Provide admin email (admin1@trizel-ai.com) for verification

### Domain Transfer Policy

If the domain is to be transferred to another GitHub repository or account:

1. Remove the CNAME file from this repository (via pull request)
2. Verify domain is released in GitHub Pages settings
3. Add CNAME file to the new repository
4. Update this dossier to reflect the transfer (or archive this dossier)

**Governance Note:** Domain binding and unbinding must follow the same PR-based workflow as all Layer-2 changes.
